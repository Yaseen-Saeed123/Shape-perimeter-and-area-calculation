### This calculator calculates perimeter and area for squares, rectangles, circles or parallelograms

### 1- Square
##### Inputs : Side or diagonal
##### If the input was a diagonal, the calc function calculates the side from the formula s = d / sqrt(2)
##### Output: Side, Area and Perimeter of the square

### 2- Rectangle
##### Inputs : Length and width
##### Output: Length, Width, Area and Perimeter of the rectangle

### 3- Circle
##### Inputs : Diameter or Radius
##### If the input was a diameter, the calc function calculates the side from the formula r = d / 2
##### Output: radius, Area and Circumference of the circle

### 4- Parallelogram
##### Inputs : first base, second base & height corresponding to the first base
##### Output: First base, second base, height corresponding to the first base, Area and Perimeter of the parallelogram
